This program is a command line custom runner for Sequential Probability Ratio Tests for Chess engines.

The menu allows you to
1) Start a new test
2) Continue an existing test
3) Delete an existing test

Completed tests still show on the list of tests and may be continued.

When creating a new test, you will be prompted for
1) the filepath to the two engines to test and names for them
2) the input variables to the test

You may pause a test midway and save it for future continuation.
When paused, the current LLR and table of results is displayed.
